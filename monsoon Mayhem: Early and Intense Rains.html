  <h1>üåßÔ∏è Monsoon Mayhem: Early and Intense Rains Hit India</h1>
  <p>This year, the monsoon has arrived early and with unexpected force. Cities like Mumbai, Kerala, and parts of Delhi are experiencing heavy rainfall, leading to flooding, traffic jams, and major disruptions in daily life. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted early rains, but the intensity has surprised many.</p>
  <p>Mumbai, known for its monsoon struggles, saw the highest rainfall in 10 years in just 24 hours. Streets are waterlogged, trains are delayed, and people are stuck in offices and homes. In some areas, schools have been closed for safety.</p>
  <p>Kerala, where the monsoon first hits the mainland, is on red alert. The government has set up emergency teams and rescue boats in low-lying regions. Many rivers are overflowing, causing damage to houses and farmland.</p>
  <p>Delhi, too, is bracing for heavy rains. While the rain brings relief from the summer heat, it also brings the risk of floods and water-borne diseases. Officials are asking people to avoid unnecessary travel and stay indoors during heavy showers.</p>
  <p>Experts say climate change is a key reason for such extreme weather patterns. Rising temperatures increase moisture in the air, which leads to heavier rainfall.</p>
  <p>The public is advised to follow weather updates and take precautions. With more rain expected in the coming weeks, the monsoon mayhem is far from over. While the rains are essential for crops and water supply, better planning is needed to deal with their impact on cities and daily life.</p>
